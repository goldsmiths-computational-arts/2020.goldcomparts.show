*Results May Vary* is an interactive performance influenced in real-time by using the audience's recollections of the lockdown.

The audience is invited to reflect on their emotional journey through lockdown by answering a series of questions. With branching narratives and direct interactions with the performance, *Results May Vary* acts as a ‘performative survey’, portraying the collective memories of the specific audience interacting in the moment, making each performance unique.

Originated from a series of in-depth interviews, collecting real-life stories, the performance aims at highlighting the thoughts and feelings of this pandemic. It invites the audience to empathise with the diversity of experiences and circumstances and offers a space to reflect on what has been missed, enjoyed and learned, and how it will influence our approach to the new normal.

The performance uses computer vision effects and audio samples that are affected in real-time by the audience input. Thanks to a custom user interface, with live-stream and interactive elements presented side-by-side, audience members can enjoy the performance directly in the browser, from the comfort of their home, or directly on-site.

*Results May Vary is presented in a 15 minutes format for Chimera Garden and is a working in progress towards a longer piece.*
