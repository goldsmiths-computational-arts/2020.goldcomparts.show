"Diffusion" is a performance (Interactive installation) 
that uses a  brainwave sensor (EEG) to convert the intangible abstraction brain activity, 
thinking, or feeling into tangible things such as sounds, objects, sculptures.

As well as using this interactive project in connection with human brain activity, 
it will unleash the inherent meaning between 
thought and matter, concept and object, human and machine.

Performer: Dahong Wang, Yuhao Yin, Meijun Xu
