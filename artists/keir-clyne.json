Through the reformatting of dance and choreographic practises, Keir uses non-human and group participation within the process of creating work to unbalance the hierarchical structure of power within traditional dance practises.</p>\n<p>Their work also draws inspiration from both academia, such as non-humanism studies and queer theory, as well as pop culture such as video gaming culture and early web aesthetics.</p>\n<p>Graduating from a BA(Hons) in Dance &amp; Choreography at Falmouth University (2018) Keir then attended an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon College of Arts (2019).

Upon arrival they can explore the ruins of the world left behind by past visitors, create new structures and shrines or even tear down whatever is remaining. The world is constantly in flux, and although the foundations remain the same, the world undergoes dynamic and drastic changes. This work acts as a queering of Keir’s childhood gaming influences (such as Age of Empires and Minecraft) by reformatting these inherently heteronormative game worlds whilst bringing to light how many queer communities have flourished within the confides of virtual worlds.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-18T14:15:00.000Z","duration":60,"livestream":true,"physical":false,"title":"Discussion Panel : Is the artist the creator or curator?","username":"dpate002, hryan003, nadam001, kclyn001","themes":"Thing Power, Multispecies Rehearsal, Paracomputing","medium":"Discussion Panel","desc":"This panel is a chance for discussion around what it means to make art, even when the art might make itself. *moderated by artist, writer and curator Tamar Clarke-Brown*.","id":57}]}
