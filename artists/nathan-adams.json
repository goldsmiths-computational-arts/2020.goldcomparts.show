When performances become virtual, and everyone is a DJ, what is the meaning of interaction in performance. What happens when the performer creates a work, throws out into the either, and casually disregards their creation until it is time to close it down and shut it up. Are you howling into the void?</p>\n<p>Affordances is an audio-visual installation, created in Cycling 74’s Max which explores ideas of deterministic sound generation, by using standard user interface elements to recreate a pachinko machine, where ball bearings are replaced by Max’s bangs, and rewards are replaced by instructions to a quadrophonic sound engine. In creating these instructions, a photo-language is created, representing the soundscape in a list of vectors, which can be replayed at anytime.</p>\n<p>The installation will be started on Thursday 17th September and will run continuously till Sunday 20th with no further intervention from the artist.
