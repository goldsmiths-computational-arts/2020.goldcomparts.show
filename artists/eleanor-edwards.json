It is core to Eleanor's practice to project an increasingly inclusive art world in contrast to her early artistic experiences. As she continues to explore this relationship she intends to work across a variety of media and method by ultimately combining computation and outcome, her long-term goal is to redefine what it means to be a maze designer.</p>\n<p>Eleanor is currently a Junior Developer at The Mill (London) where she works primarily within Augmented Reality.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/10/2020 10:48:19","email":"eedwa001@gold.ac.uk","title":"Co-produced","videoDocUrl":null,"interactiveUrl":"https://nameless-hollows-56395.herokuapp.com/","streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Expanded Terrains","Generative poetics","Experiential array"],"media":["interactive","playable experience"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"<p>Follow the link to bring the Art Object to you</p>\n","artworkHTML":"<p>Co-produced is a technical exploration that forms part of a wider body of work by the artist in an investigation into the relationship sphere of the art object, interrogating the bonds between the art object, the audience and the artist. This piece in particular is the result of the artist’s intentions to expand their technical skills to enable them to reframe the potential of future art objects and artistic outcomes.</p>\n<p>The format of web app that is used widens the scope of engagement opportunities beyond the boundaries in which the work is physically enclosed. The chosen platform is a direct reflection of a previous work in this series, <em>doNOTtouch</em> (2020), available on the artist’s Vimeo [https://vimeo.com/eleanoredwards], which focused around a single physical point of interaction and therefore the Art Object:Audience relationship was restricted to localised engagement. Co-produced goes beyond this through its media, utilising the flexibility of the web which by its nature allows for a wider reach in connections,. Through this the Audience is able to bring the Art Object to them - changing the power dynamic within the relationship sphere.</p>\n","events":[]}
