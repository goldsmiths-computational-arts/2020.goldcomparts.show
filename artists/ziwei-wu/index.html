In this experimental art piece, cameras will be recording plants in real-time, and through a genetic algorithm the color and shape of virtual insects will be generated and evolved over time, toward the ultimate goal of visually blending into the recorded background. This simulated breeding, selection, and mutation are visualized across the video monitors positioned in front of the aforementioned living plants as they progress. In addition to exploring the intersection between nature and computation, we find that this work has relevance to the human society as well, as Walter Lippmann describes it in his book Public Opinion, people construct a pseudo- environment that is a subjective, biased, and necessarily abridged mental image of the world, and to a degree, everyone’s pseudo-environment is a fiction. The setup of the installation is an homage to Nam June Paik ’s TV Garden. Paik imagined a future landscape where technology is an integral part of the natural world. We find that perspective compelling even today in 2020.</p> </div> <div class="svelte-h6sy7k artwork-instructions"><h3 class=svelte-h6sy7k>How to interact</h3> <p>no interaction</p> </div> <br> <div></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k section responsive-video"><div class=container><div class="embed-container svelte-13teyld"><iframe allowfullscreen frameborder=0 src=https://player.vimeo.com/video/435536041></iframe></div></div></section> <section class="bg-col-2 col-6 section"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k container see-more"><h2 class=svelte-h6sy7k>Want to see more?</h2> <div class=columns><div class=column><p>LIVE ONLINE</p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k><li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#62 style=color:#fff>Spotlight Panel: How do we create artistic realities with new technologies?</a> - Saturday 19 Sep 13.00 </ul></div> <div class="column is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div></div> <div class=column><p>ON SITE</p> <p>Goldsmiths, University of London <br> St James Hatcham Building </p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k></ul></div></div></div> <div class=columns><div class="column is-hidden-mobile"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div> <div class=column><div><a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../getting-there>Getting There </a> </div></div></div></div></section></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 section artists-section"><div class="container page-max-width"><div class=content><div class=columns><div class="column is-one-third"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k bio-photo" style=background-image:url(img/bios/zwu003.jpeg)></div> <div class="is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><h2 class="svelte-h6sy7k artist-name">Ziwei Wu </h2> <div class=artist-bio><p>Ziwei Wu is an second year MFA student in Computational Arts at Goldsmiths, University of London.
