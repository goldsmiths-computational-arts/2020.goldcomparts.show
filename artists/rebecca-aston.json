Memory and temporality are central to her art practice, both as subject matter and as medium — namely capture technologies, computation and the moving image. In addition to engaging with symbolic and narrative elements, she works on the level of the affective and perceptual, thinking about visceral responses to light, sound, motion and color. As a Zimbabwean artist, she questions narratives of whiteness, especially within settler colonial identities and the empires that bred them; Zimbabwean history is central source material in much of her work. Rebecca is an artist and creative technologist, within both her commercial and artistic work she utilizes a range of technologies, from the web to virtual reality. Born and raised in Zimbabwe, she is currently based in London. She lived and worked as a web developer in the USA after obtaining a BA in Fine Art from Yale.</p>\n","timestamp":"9/11/2020 16:20:37","email":"rasto001@gold.ac.uk","title":"Ground","wallTextInstructions":null,"videoDocUrl":null,"interactiveUrl":null,"streamTwitch":null,"streamYouTube":null,"themes":["Non-directional travel","Experiential array","Memory bank"],"media":["VR"],"numImages":1,"found":true,"webInstructionsHTML":"","artworkHTML":"<p>Grounded in a shifting terrain, living in the sediments of the past, disorientation becomes the only thing to hold onto. <em>Ground</em> is a Virtual Reality piece that celebrates groundlessness and change, claiming disorientation as a positive state to feel your way into or through. Within the work, texture is used as a way to rethink a ground—the present moment—that is in constant flux, steeped in history and memory. As texture exists at the border of sight, touch and sound it becomes a device to recall and remix time and space. <em>Ground</em> uses the medium of Virtual Reality to think about perception and embodiment. Following a meandering line through abstract painting, color theory, minimalist sculpture and light art, <em>Ground</em> uses abstraction, light and the relationship between bodies and the worlds they are perceiving. A gaze controller allows a user to change and animate the virtual world by moving their head and looking around, which results in visual and aural textures that build up to a synaesthetic and embodied experience. The work is appearing as a performative demonstration within the <em>Chimera Garden</em> exhibition.</p>\n","events":[{"startTime":"2020-09-17T17:20:00.000Z","duration":10,"livestream":false,"physical":"yes","title":"Ground","username":"rasto001","themes":"Experiential array, Non-directional travel, Memory bank","medium":"VR","desc":"Grounded in a shifting terrain, living in the sediments of the past, disorientation becomes the only thing to hold onto.
