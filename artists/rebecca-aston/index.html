Within the work, texture is used as a way to rethink a ground—the present moment—that is in constant flux, steeped in history and memory. As texture exists at the border of sight, touch and sound it becomes a device to recall and remix time and space. <em>Ground</em> uses the medium of Virtual Reality to think about perception and embodiment. Following a meandering line through abstract painting, color theory, minimalist sculpture and light art, <em>Ground</em> uses abstraction, light and the relationship between bodies and the worlds they are perceiving. A gaze controller allows a user to change and animate the virtual world by moving their head and looking around, which results in visual and aural textures that build up to a synaesthetic and embodied experience. The work is appearing as a performative demonstration within the <em>Chimera Garden</em> exhibition.</p> </div> <br> <div></div></div></section> <section class="bg-col-2 col-6 section"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k container see-more"><h2 class=svelte-h6sy7k>Want to see more?</h2> <div class=columns><div class=column><p>LIVE ONLINE</p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k><li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#23 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Saturday 19 Sep 11.50 <li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#62 style=color:#fff>Spotlight Panel : How do we create artistic realities with new technologies?</a> - Saturday 19 Sep 13.00 </ul></div> <div class="column is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div></div> <div class=column><p>ON SITE</p> <p>Goldsmiths, University of London <br> St James Hatcham Building </p> <div class=event-schedule style=padding-bottom:10px><ul class=svelte-h6sy7k><li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#2 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Thursday 17 Sep 18.20 <li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#14 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Friday 18 Sep 17.00 <li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#23 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Saturday 19 Sep 11.50 <li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#34 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Saturday 19 Sep 17.30 <li><a class=svelte-h6sy7k href=/schedule#51 style=color:#fff>Ground</a> - Sunday 20 Sep 15.45 </ul></div></div></div> <div class=columns><div class="column is-hidden-mobile"><div> <a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../schedule>Full Schedule </a></div></div> <div class=column><div><a class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 bd-col-7 col-2 rounded-link" href=../getting-there>Getting There </a> </div></div></div></div></section></div></div></section> <section class="svelte-h6sy7k bg-col-7 section artists-section"><div class="container page-max-width"><div class=content><div class=columns><div class="column is-one-third"><div class="svelte-h6sy7k bio-photo" style=background-image:url(img/bios/rasto001.jpeg)></div> <div class="is-hidden-desktop is-hidden-tablet"><h2 class="svelte-h6sy7k artist-name">Rebecca Aston </h2> <div class=artist-bio><p>Rebecca Aston examines the relationship between personal lived experience and collective historic records.
