The work is also informed by the tradition of making grimoires, taking the practice of recording elements, recipes and rituals and augmenting it into a programmable processes. <em>Programmoire</em> finds magic squares within the possibility space of number sequences, and studies their structure across one, two and three dimensions to record the emergent paths, patterns and forms within them.</p>\n<p><em>The Work Station</em> is an installation creating a speculative workstation for studying magic squares. A printed portion of <em>Programmoire</em> sits on the table, while the wall is turned into a control panel of sorts.
